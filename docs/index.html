    <h1>DannyNiu/NJF homepage at GitHub</h1>

    <p>
      My interest spans a spectrum of areas in IT and digital media.
      As a programmer, I mostly work with web technologies and use them
      to build consumer/prosumer and professional applications, with
      focus and effort on security. The programming paradigm I'm most
      familiar with is <i>procedural</i>, so some OOP or functional
      folks may see my codes as "having an accent".
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's the set of technology I work with, and my skill level.
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th> Technology </th>
          <th> Familiarity </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td> C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Unix/Linux </td>
          <td>
            Very familiar except
            a few syntax details
            and/or some API usage.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td> Perl, Python, Unity and Unity C#, Security </td>
          <td> Capable, but not without references. </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td> SQL, Maths, Statistics, Domain-Specific Disciplines </td>
          <td> Very Basic. </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
