    <h1>DannyNiu/NJF homepage at GitHub</h1>

    <p>
      Hi there. I'm a Chinese RuanKao certified InfoSec engineer that
      develops WebApps and C language programs and libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm most familiar with C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Unix/Linux;
      could do a bit of Perl, Python, Unity/C#; still learning SQL,
      advanced mathematics, statistics, etc.
    </p>

    <h1>Selected Projects</h1>

    <p>Here's a select few projects that I've been doing:</p>

    <p><a href="/MySuiteA"><b>MySuiteA</b></a> -
      a cryptography library.</p>

    <p><a href="/SafeTypes2"><b>SafeTypes2</b></a> -
      implements data buffer, dictionary map, and linked list data types,
      as well as a precise garbage collector operating on them that's
      threading aware. This project is intended to support developing
      run-time for higher-level languages, although for now, it aims to
      prove its usefulness by augmenting the existing C standard library.
    </p>
