    <h1>A few thoughts after reading "ASN.1 Complete"</h1>

    <p>Author: DannyNiu/NJF, 2021-02-12</p>

    <p>
      The first time I encountered ASN.1 was when I graduated from internship
      and became formally employed. I needed to study SSL/TLS and to manage the
      website certificate. I looked up specification for X.509 certificates,
      but I couldn't understand how they're encoded, because the semantics are
      specified in abstract syntax notation, with encoding rules only mentioned
      in reference citations.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a professional hobby, I read various cryptography standards, and
      what confused me for a long time was the esoteric notations used in
      PKCS#1 and SEC#1 ASN.1 module specifications. I spent some time reading
      "ASN.1 Complete" by Prof. John Larmouth, and it helped me understood
      what those hash-sign standards were talking about.
    </p>

    <p>
      The book is a lengthy read. If I were to describe how I feel when I
      read it - if The C Programming Language was writing an HTML page,
      then ASN.1 Complete would be editing the internal XML content of an
      ODT or a DOCX file with <code>ed</code>. The book "ASN.1 Complete", and
      ASN.1, will be the topic of this article.
    </p>

    <p>
      In essence, ASN.1 is just a schema language for defining data structures
      intended for exchange between computing systems. It was originally
      specified in union with BER in X.409 (which is now out of stock), and so
      ASN.1 can be seen as a textual representation of BER, in the same vein
      that assembly language is the textual representation of machine code.
    </p>

    <p>
      While reading the book, you see some of the recurring themes which feel
      like being advertised to you as the selling point of ASN.1 - they were
      relevant back then, but not now as our understanding of
      IT engineering progresses. I would advise readers of that book to be
      vigilant about some IT engineering practices that the book describes -
      those ideas aren't false, but in general, an engineering would not
      solve it using ASN.1 alone.
    </p>

    <h2>Problems that the book claimed/implied ASN.1 solves</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        ASN.1 seperates encoding/decoding from
        application implementation and its documentation.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each application might have specific needs that a
            generic notation or codec cannot accommondate.
            And this is evidented by the several reworking of
            how "holes" (parts filled by higher-layer protocols)
            are defined.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        ASN.1 provides provision for paving way for a "version 2" protocol
        in the "version 1" specification.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Compatibility between implementations of different versions
            of a protocol is more complicated than just a data-level ASN.1
            specification, and cannot be solved by ASN.1 alone. While ASN.1
            provides provisions for cross-version compatibility, the
            book made the wrong impression that we can solve it with
            ASN.1 alone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most application can just negotiate protocol versions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Leaving room in the base system for higher-layer and/or
        companion protocols to fill in.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Practically all protocols are capable of that. But ASN.1
            is trying too hard to make the base system aware of those
            higher-layer and companion protocols' semantics.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Modern Engineering Wisdom</h2>

    <p>
      A modern protocol specification would specify more than just
      message formats. A modern specification must be useful for
      guiding use and implementation, and should be able to serve as
      basis for arguring correctness and security.
    </p>

    <p>
      As such, in addition to message formats, a modern protocol specification
      would/might specify:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Parsing and serialization rules and all associated error handling.
        Usually in the form of pseudo-codes or bullet-point list of steps.
        <ul>
          <li>
            ASN.1 solves this problem, but in a one-size-fit-all approach.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Actions to be taken upon the success or failure to receive or send
        messages; as well as how such events are reported to the invoker
        of the protocol instance.
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is completely outside the scope of ASN.1, but an integral
            component of a formal specification.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Design rationales, implementation guide and/or recommendations
        (which are especially important when they'd be available as
        first-hand information), provisions for extensions, etc.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The point here, is to remind everyone that protocol design
            is absolutely much more than just specifying message formats.
            ASN.1 teaches the notation (and its encodings), but in no way
            how to desgin protocols. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
